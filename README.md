# Fermionic operators

This programs numerically defines fermionic operators through a matrix representation.
The original intention is to estimate fermionic operators in a given state, but it can serve for a variety of problems.
The only input the program needs is the dimension, and the corresponding one and two body fermionic operators will be automatically defined.
